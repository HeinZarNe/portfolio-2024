It is fully responsive and functional, making it easily accessible from a variety of devices. One of the key features of your dictionary is its loader support. This provides a visual indicator to the user that their search request is being processed and helps to improve the overall user experience. Another important feature is the error message support, which notifies the user when their search query is not found in the dictionary. This helps to prevent confusion and ensures that the user is always provided with accurate information.",
